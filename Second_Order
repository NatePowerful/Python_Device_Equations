    second order function using first order free carrier solution 
    
    This does not plot, it:
    1) calls the intial first order function to get n and p
    2) computes Ef - Ei for electrons using kT*ln(n/ni)
    3) builds a grid that maps for which points on the map using the temperature/doping combinations are degenerate and non-degenerate

    Parameters:
    material - object (e.g,, Si, SiC, InAs) that must provide ni(T) method
        T: array-like or float 
            Temperature(s) I would like to check for degeneracy, measured in Kelvin
        NA: array-like or float
            How much P-type doping there is (acceptors) 
        ND:
            How much N-type doping there is (donors)
        degeneracy_threshhold: float
            Sets the cuttoff for deciding when the material becomes degenerate.
            Usually use 3*KT based off class notes
